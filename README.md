# MetaWear Starter Project
This is a universal (iOS/tvOS/macOS) App which serves as an initial starting point for building MetaWear applications.

## ATTENTION!
We use [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) for dependency management, this means you need to open **StarterProject.xcworkspace** and not StarterProject.xcodeproj.
